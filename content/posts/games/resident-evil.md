Ever get that feeling of dread when you're exploring a creepy mansion and hear a moan in the distance? Welcome to the world of Resident Evil, a gaming franchise that's been scaring the pants off people since 1996. This isn't just a shoot-em-up about zombies (although there are plenty of those too). Resident Evil is all about surviving in a world gone wrong, with limited ammo, tricky puzzles, and some seriously messed-up monsters.

**Tank Controls and Herb Mixing: How it all Began**

Imagine exploring a haunted house blindfolded. That's kinda what the early Resident Evil games were like. Tank controls (think turning left and right in place) and fixed camera angles kept you on edge, because you never quite knew what lurked around the corner. On top of that, you couldn't just hoard everything you found. Every bullet, healing herb (seriously, mixing herbs is a thing!), and rusty key had weight. It forced you to think strategically about what to carry and how to use it.

Things got a bit more flexible as the series went on. Cameras moved around more, and you could actually run (gasp!). But the core of Resident Evil – making the most of what you have and solving those head-scratching puzzles – stuck around. These puzzles can be real mind-benders, involving finding weird key items, deciphering cryptic messages, and backtracking through creepy areas – all while avoiding those flesh-eating ghouls. 

**Umbrella Corporation: Not Your Average Pharmaceutical Company**

The whole Resident Evil mess can be blamed on one corrupt company: Umbrella Corporation. These shady folks made a bunch of nasty viruses that turned everyday people into horrifying monsters – zombies being just the tip of the iceberg. 

Throughout the games, you'll play as different heroes trying to stop Umbrella's evil schemes. There's S.T.A.R.S., an elite police unit who stumble into a nightmare town (Resident Evil 1 & 2), and Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie cop who has a very bad day in a zombie-infested city (Resident Evil 2 & 4). More recent entries introduced Ethan Winters, a regular guy who gets dragged into a creepy mold-filled plantation looking for his missing wife (Resident Evil 7: Biohazard). 

**More Than Just Games: A World of Resident Evil** 

Resident Evil is much bigger than just video games. There are movies, animated shows, comics, and even books based on this messed-up world. These tell new stories and flesh out the lore of the franchise. So if you beat the games and want more Resident Evil chills, there's plenty to explore. 

**Should You Play Resident Evil? You Bet!** 

If you're looking for a thrilling and terrifying good time, Resident Evil delivers. It'll make you jump, rack your brain, and feel like a total badass when you finally escape whatever nightmare you're in. The games have changed a lot over the years, so there's something for fans of both old-school horror and modern action-fests. So grab a controller, find a buddy (maybe), and dive into Resident Evil. Just remember, conserve your ammo – those zombies aren't gonna kill themselves!
