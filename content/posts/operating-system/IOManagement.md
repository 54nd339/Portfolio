## Introduction

I/O Management is the process of managing input and output operations in a computer system which involves coordinating the flow of data between the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. I/O Management is an integral part of any operating system with the primary goal of providing a way to communicate with external devices and manage the flow of data between the computer and its peripherals. I/O Management is responsible for managing the input and output devices, handling the data transfer between the devices and the CPU, and providing a way to access and control the devices.
