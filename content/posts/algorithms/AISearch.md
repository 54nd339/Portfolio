## Types of AI Search Algorithms

There are several types of AI search algorithms, including:

### Uninformed Search Algorithms

These algorithms do not have any additional information about the problem other than the problem definition. Examples of uninformed search algorithms include breadth-first search, depth-first search, and uniform-cost search.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores all the nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth. It is used to find the shortest path from a source node to a target node in an unweighted graph. Below is the pseudocode for BFS.

```pseudocode
function BFS(graph, source, target):
    queue = new Queue()
    visited = new Set()
    queue.enqueue(source)
    visited.add(source)
    while queue is not empty:
        node = queue.dequeue()
        if node is target:
            return true
        for neighbor in graph.neighbors(node):
            if neighbor is not visited:
                queue.enqueue(neighbor)
                visited.add(neighbor)
    return false
```

**Depth-First Search (DFS)**: DFS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is used to find the shortest path from a source node to a target node in a weighted graph. Below is the pseudocode for DFS.

```pseudocode
function DFS(graph, source, target):
    stack = new Stack()
    visited = new Set()
    stack.push(source)
    visited.add(source)
    while stack is not empty:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node is target:
            return true
        for neighbor in graph.neighbors(node):
            if neighbor is not visited:
                stack.push(neighbor)
                visited.add(neighbor)
    return false
```

**Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**: UCS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores the nodes in the order of their path cost from the source node. It is used to find the shortest path from a source node to a target node in a weighted graph. Below is the pseudocode for UCS.

```pseudocode
function UCS(graph, source, target):
    priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue()
    visited = new Set()
    priorityQueue.enqueue((source, 0))
    visited.add(source)
    while priorityQueue is not empty:
        (node, cost) = priorityQueue.dequeue()
        if node is target:
            return true
        for neighbor in graph.neighbors(node):
            if neighbor is not visited:
                priorityQueue.enqueue((neighbor, cost + graph.cost(node, neighbor)))
                visited.add(neighbor)
    return false
```

### Informed Search Algorithms
These algorithms use additional information about the problem to guide the search process. Examples of informed search algorithms include A* search, greedy best-first search, and iterative deepening A* search.

**A\* Search**: A* search is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from the source node to the target node. It is used to find the shortest path from a source node to a target node in a weighted graph. Below is the pseudocode for A* search.

```pseudocode
function AStarSearch(graph, source, target):
    priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue()
    visited = new Set()
    priorityQueue.enqueue((source, 0))
    visited.add(source)
    while priorityQueue is not empty:
        (node, cost) = priorityQueue.dequeue()
        if node is target:
            return true
        for neighbor in graph.neighbors(node):
            if neighbor is not visited:
                priorityQueue.enqueue((neighbor, cost + graph.cost(node, neighbor) + heuristic(neighbor, target)))
                visited.add(neighbor)
    return false
```

**Greedy Best-First Search**: Greedy best-first search is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from the source node to the target node. It is used to find the shortest path from a source node to a target node in a weighted graph. Below is the pseudocode for greedy best-first search.

```pseudocode
function GreedyBestFirstSearch(graph, source, target):
    priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue()
    visited = new Set()
    priorityQueue.enqueue((source, heuristic(source, target)))
    visited.add(source)
    while priorityQueue is not empty:
        (node, cost) = priorityQueue.dequeue()
        if node is target:
            return true
        for neighbor in graph.neighbors(node):
            if neighbor is not visited:
                priorityQueue.enqueue((neighbor, heuristic(neighbor, target)))
                visited.add(neighbor)
    return false
```

**Iterative Deepening A\* Search**: Iterative deepening A* search is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from the source node to the target node. It is used to find the shortest path from a source node to a target node in a weighted graph. Below is the pseudocode for iterative deepening A* search.

```pseudocode
function IterativeDeepeningAStarSearch(graph, source, target):
    depth = 0
    while true:
        result = DepthLimitedAStarSearch(graph, source, target, depth)
        if result is not null:
            return result
        depth = depth + 1
```

### Local Search Algorithms

These algorithms are used to find a solution by making small changes to the current solution. Examples of local search algorithms include hill climbing, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms.

**Hill Climbing**: Hill climbing is a local search algorithm that starts with an initial solution and iteratively makes small changes to the solution to find a better solution. It is used to find the optimal solution to a problem by searching through a large space of possible solutions. Below is the pseudocode for hill climbing.

```pseudocode
function HillClimbing(problem):
    current = problem.initialSolution
    while true:
        neighbor = problem.getBestNeighbor(current)
        if problem.value(neighbor) <= problem.value(current):
            return current
        current = neighbor
```

**Simulated Annealing**: Simulated annealing is a local search algorithm that starts with an initial solution and iteratively makes small changes to the solution to find a better solution. It is used to find the optimal solution to a problem by searching through a large space of possible solutions. Below is the pseudocode for simulated annealing.

```pseudocode

function SimulatedAnnealing(problem):
    current = problem.initialSolution
    temperature = problem.initialTemperature
    while temperature > 0:
        neighbor = problem.getRandomNeighbor(current)
        delta = problem.value(neighbor) - problem.value(current)
        if delta < 0 or Math.random() < Math.exp(-delta / temperature):
            current = neighbor
        temperature = problem.coolingSchedule(temperature)
    return current
```

**Genetic Algorithms**: Genetic algorithms are a class of local search algorithms that use the principles of natural selection to find the optimal solution to a problem. They start with an initial population of solutions and iteratively make small changes to the solutions to find a better solution. Below is the pseudocode for genetic algorithms.

```pseudocode
function GeneticAlgorithm(problem):
    population = problem.initialPopulation
    while true:
        newPopulation = new Array()
        for i from 1 to problem.populationSize:
            parent1 = problem.selectParent(population)
            parent2 = problem.selectParent(population)
            child = problem.crossover(parent1, parent2)
            child = problem.mutate(child)
            newPopulation.add(child)
        population = newPopulation
        if problem.isSolution(population):
            return population
```
