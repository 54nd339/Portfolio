# The Chronology of the Universe in Eight Thresholds

Our story begins with the inception of space and time and winds its way through the formation of stars and planets, the emergence of life, the rise of humanity, and the rapid advances of modern civilization. The universe is a vast and complex place, and its history is a long and intricate one. But by breaking it down into eight key thresholds:

1. Creation – The Big Bang and Cosmogony
2. Formation – The Birth and Evolution of Stars
3. Elements – The Stellar Origin of the Elements
4. Planets – The cradle of Life
5. Life – The Emergence of Life on Earth
6. Intelligence – The Evolution of Human Intelligence
7. Civilization – The Rise of Agriculture & Industrialization
8. Modernity – The Acceleration to Modernity

## Threshold 1: Creation – The Big Bang and Cosmogony

This threshold covers the very early Universe—from the initial singularity through a series of dramatic epochs that established the cosmic structure we observe today. The universe began with the Big Bang, a cataclysmic event that marked the beginning of space and time. In the first few moments after the Big Bang, the universe was a seething cauldron of energy and matter, expanding and cooling at an incredible rate. As the universe expanded and cooled, the first particles began to form, eventually coalescing into the first atoms and molecules. The universe continued to evolve, giving rise to the first stars and galaxies, and eventually to the complex structure we see today.

### Key Concepts

**Planck Scale**: The Planck scale is the physical scale beyond which current physical theories may not apply and cannot be used to reliably predict any events. Length, mass, time and tempature for planck scale are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
l_p &= \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-35} \text{m} \\
m_p &= \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}} \approx 2.2 \times 10^{-8} \text{kg} \\
t_p &= \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}} \approx 5.4 \times 10^{-44} \text{s} \\
T_p &= \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G k_B^2}} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{32} \text{K}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Quantum Fluctuations**: Quantum fluctuations are the temporary changes in the amount of energy in a point in space, as predicted by the uncertainty principle. They are a fundamental property of quantum mechanics and are responsible for many of the phenomena observed in the microscopic world.

**Vacuum State**: Vacuum state is a configuration of quantum fields representing a local minimum (but not necessarily a global minimum) of energy. According to general relativity, any vacuum state with non-zero energy density generates a repulsive force that leads to an expansion of space. This is the basis for the theory of cosmic inflation, which explains the large-scale structure of the cosmos.

**Singularity**: A singularity is a point in space-time where the curvature becomes infinite, and the laws of physics break down. The Big Bang is thought to have originated from a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature due to the gravitational collapse of a previous universe or the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum.

**Grand Unified Theory (GUT)**: The Grand Unified Theory (GUT) is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify the three non-gravitational forces of the Standard Model (electromagnetic, weak, and strong) into a single force. At the GUT scale, the forces are thought to have been indistinguishable, and the particles of the Standard Model were massless and interchangeable. This unified interaction is characterized by one larger gauge symmetry and thus one coupling constant.

**Cosmic Inflation**: Cosmic inflation is a period of extremely rapid expansion of the universe that occurred in the first few moments after the Big Bang. It is thought to have been driven by a repulsive force generated by the vacuum state of the early universe. Inflation explains many of the observed features of the universe, such as its large-scale homogeneity and isotropy.

**Sakharov conditions**: The Sakharov conditions are three necessary conditions for baryogenesis, the process by which the universe came to have more matter than antimatter. The conditions are:

- Baryon number violation: The laws of physics must allow for processes that violate the conservation of baryon number.
- C and CP violation: The laws of physics must violate the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) in order to generate a net baryon asymmetry.
- Departure from thermal equilibrium: The universe must be out of thermal equilibrium in order for baryogenesis to occur.

**Cosmic Neutrino Background**: The cosmic neutrino background is a relic of the Big Bang, consisting of a sea of neutrinos left over from the early universe. These neutrinos are extremely difficult to detect due to their weak interactions with matter, but they are thought to play a crucial role in the evolution of the cosmos.

**Nucleosynthesis**: Nucleosynthesis is the process by which the nuclei of atoms are formed in the cores of stars. It is responsible for the creation of most of the elements in the universe, from hydrogen and helium to the heavier elements like carbon and oxygen. Nucleosynthesis is thought to have occurred in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, when the universe was still hot and dense.

**Cosmic Microwave Background**: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is infrared and some red black-body radiation emitted when the universe was at a temperature of some 3000 K, redshifted by a factor of 1100 from the visible spectrum to the microwave spectrum. The CMB is a snapshot of the oldest light in our Universe imprinted on the sky. It shows tiny temperature fluctuations that correspond to regions of slightly different densities, representing the seeds of all future structure: the stars and galaxies of today.

**Hubble's Law**: Hubble's law is a fundamental relationship in cosmology that describes the expansion of the universe. It states that the velocity at which a galaxy is receding from us is proportional to its distance from us. This relationship is encapsulated in the equation $v = H_0 d$, where $v$ is the velocity, $d$ is the distance, and $H_0$ is the Hubble constant.

$$
v = H_0 d
$$

where $H_0$ is the Hubble constant, which is the rate at which the universe is expanding today.

**Cosmological Principle & FLRW Metric**: The cosmological principle is the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. This principle underlies the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, which describes the geometry of the universe in the context of general relativity. The FLRW metric is a key component of the standard model of cosmology:

$$
ds^2 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2 \left(\frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2} + r^2 d\Omega^2\right)
$$

where $ds$ is the spacetime interval, $dt$ is the time interval, $a(t)$ is the scale factor, $r$ is the comoving radial coordinate, $k$ is the curvature parameter, and $d\Omega^2$ is the solid angle element.

**Friedmann Equations**: The Friedmann equations are a set of equations that describe the evolution of the universe in the context of general relativity. They relate the expansion rate of the universe to the energy density and pressure of the various components of the universe, such as matter, radiation, and dark energy.

$$
H^2 \equiv \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{k}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{3}
$$

where $H$ is the Hubble parameter, $a$ is the scale factor, $\rho$ is the energy density, $k$ is the curvature parameter (0 for flat, +1 for closed, -1 for open), and $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant.

**\Lambda CDM Model**: The Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is the current standard model of cosmology, based on cosmological principle, the FLRW metric and the general theory of relativity. It posits that the universe is composed of 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter, and 68.3% dark energy, and it explains the observed expansion of the universe, the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the distribution of galaxies.

**Dark Matter**: Dark matter is a form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, and is therefore invisible to telescopes. It is thought to make up about 85% of the matter in the universe, and its presence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter. Dark matter is believed to play a crucial role in the formation of galaxies and large-scale structure in the universe.

**Dark Energy**: Dark energy is a mysterious form of energy that is thought to make up about 70% of the total energy density of the universe. It is responsible for the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe and is thought to be associated with the vacuum energy of empty space. The nature of dark energy is one of the most pressing questions in modern cosmology.

**Perturbation Theory**: Perturbation theory is a mathematical technique used to study the evolution of small deviations from a known solution to a differential equation. In cosmology, perturbation theory is used to study the growth of structure in the universe, such as the formation of galaxies and large-scale structure.

**Jeans Instability**: The Jeans instability is a gravitational instability that occurs in a fluid when the pressure is not strong enough to prevent the collapse of a region of higher-than-average density. It is thought to be responsible for the formation of galaxies and large-scale structure in the universe.

$$
\lambda_J = \sqrt{\dfrac{15k_B T}{4\pi G \mu \rho}}
$$

where $\lambda_J$ is the Jeans length, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $\mu$ is the mean molecular weight, and $\rho$ is the density.

### Epochs

| Epoch                 | Time                        | Temperature (K)          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Planck                | $\lt10^{-43}$s            | $\gt10^{32}$           | The Planck scale is the physical scale beyond which current physical theories may not apply and cannot be used to reliably predict any events. During the Planck epoch, cosmology and physics are assumed to have been dominated by the quantum effects of gravity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| GUT                   | $10^{-43} \sim 10^{-36}$s | $10^{32} \sim 10^{28}$ | Gravity separates and begins operating on the universe — the remaining fundamental forces stabilize into the electronuclear force, mediated by (the hypothetical) X and Y bosons which allow early matter at this stage to fluctuate between baryon and lepton states.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Inflationary          | $10^{-36} \sim 10^{-32}$s | $10^{28} \sim 10^{27}$ | The inflationary vacuum had a much higher energy density. The universe underwent an extremely rapid exponential expansion which increased the linear dimensions of the early universe by a factor of at least$10^26$ (and possibly a much larger factor).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Electroweak           | $10^{-36} \sim 10^{-12}$s | $10^{28} \sim 10^{15}$ | The temperature had fallen enough that the strong interaction becomes distinct from the electroweak interaction. Particle interactions in this phase were energetic enough to create large numbers of exotic particles. As the universe expanded and cooled, interactions became less energetic, and W and Z bosons ceased to be created at observable rates. The vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field is zero, making the fermions and electroweak bosons massless. Photons ($\gamma$) do not yet exist.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Quark                 | $10^{-12} \sim 10^{-5}$s  | $10^{15} \sim 10^{12}$ | The remaining W and Z bosons decayed quickly, and the weak interaction became a short-range force, giving the fundamental interactions their present forms. The temperature was still too high to allow quarks to coalesce into hadrons, instead forming a quark–gluon plasma. It is possible that some part of this decay process violated the conservation of baryon number and gave rise to a small excess of baryon over anti-baryon. Higgs field has a nonzero vacuum expectation value, making fermions, Higgs boson, W and Z bosons massive. Photons were created.                                                                                                                                     |
| Hadron (Baryogenesis) | $10^{-5} \sim 1$s         | $10^{12} \sim 10^{10}$ | The average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the binding energy of hadrons to allow quarks to coalesce into hadrons but was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs. Mesons are in thermal equilibrium with their anti-matter, outnumbering baryons by about 10:1. At temperatures below the pion mass, most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were eliminated in annihilation reactions, only light-stable baryons remain. Due to the sufficiently high density of leptons, protons and neutrons rapidly change into one another under the action of weak force. Due to the higher mass of neutron the neutron:proton ratio, which is initially 1:1, starts to decrease. |
| Lepton                | $1 \sim 10$s              | $10^{10} \sim 10^{9}$  | Neutrinos cease interacting with baryonic matter, and form cosmic neutrino background. Neutron:proton ratio freezes at approximately 1:6. Leptons and antileptons remain in thermal equilibrium — energy of photons is still high enough to produce electron-positron pairs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Nucleosynthesis       | $10 \sim 10^3$s           | $10^{9} \sim 10^{7}$   | Protons and neutrons are bound into primordial atomic nuclei: H and He-4. Trace amounts of H-2, He-3, Li-7 and Be-7 also formed. Most energy at this time is in electromagnetic radiation, baryonic matter density is on the order of$4g/m^3$. Once the thermal energy dropped below 0.03 MeV, nucleosynthesis effectively came to an end setting the Primordial abundances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Photon                | $10$s $\sim 370$ka      | $10^{9} \sim 4000$     | The universe consists of a plasma of nuclei, electrons, and photons; temperature is too low to create electron-positron pairs (or any other pairs of massive particles), but too high for the binding of electrons to nuclei.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Recombination         | $18$ka $\sim 370$ka     | $4000$                 | Electrons and atomic nuclei first become bound to form neutral atoms. Photons are no longer in thermal equilibrium with matter and the universe first becomes transparent giving rise to the Cosmic Microwave Background. The baryonic matter density at this time is about 500 million hydrogen and helium atoms per$m^3$, approximately a billion times higher than today.

### Far Future:

**Stelliferous Era**: The time between the first formation of Population III stars until the cessation of star formation, leaving all stars in the form of degenerate remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes).

**Degenerate Era**: The universe is populated only by degerate remnants. Protons will begin to decay (violating the conservation of baryon number). If proton decay takes place, the sole survivors will be black holes. If so, life becomes nearly impossible as the remaining interstellar gas and stellar remnants into leptons and photons.

**Black Hole Era**: The organized matter will remain only in the form of black holes. Black holes themselves slowly "evaporate" away the matter contained in them, by the quantum mechanical process of Hawking radiation.

**Dark Era**: The universe consists only of photons, neutrinos, electrons, and positrons. With only very diffuse matter remaining, activity in the universe will have tailed off dramatically, with very low energy levels and very large time scales.

Electrons and positrons drifting through space will encounter one another and occasionally form positronium atoms. These structures are unstable, however, and their constituent particles must eventually annihilate. Other low-level annihilation events will also take place, albeit very slowly.

Essentially, the universe will eventually turn into a void. The temperature of the universe will asymptotically approach absolute zero, and the universe will be in a state of maximum entropy. in which everything is evenly distributed and there are no energy gradients to drive any further processes. This whole process of ultimate decay is known as the **Heat Death of the Universe**.

Other scenarios include:

- **Big Rip**: The expansion of space accelerates and at some point becomes so extreme that even subatomic particles and the fabric of spacetime are pulled apart and unable to exist. For any value of the dark energy content of the universe where the negative pressure ratio is less than −1, the expansion rate of the universe will continue to increase without limit. First, gravitationally bound systems, then electromagnetic systems, and finally, the fabric of spacetime itself will be torn apart. The universe will end in an unusual singularity, with the scale factor of the universe and the density of matter becoming infinite.
- **Big Crunch**: The expansion of the universe would at some point be reversed and the universe would contract towards a hot, dense state. Current observations suggest that this model of the universe is unlikely to be correct, and the expansion will continue or even accelerate.
- **Vacuum Instability**: The universe is in a false vacuum state (metastable), at any point a quantum fluctuation in spacetime might spontaneously tunnel it to a lower-energy state, which would then expand outward from that point with the speed of light, destroying everything in its path. The probability of this happening is extremely low, but not zero.

## Threshold 2: Formation – The Birth and Evolution of Stars

Stars condense from regions of space of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum chamber. These regions—known as **molecular clouds**—consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium and a few percent heavier elements.

Most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars. Massive stars in these groups powerfully illuminate those clouds, ionizing the hydrogen, and creating H II regions. Such feedback effects ultimately disrupt the cloud and prevent further star formation. All stars spend the majority of their existence as main sequence stars, fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores. However, stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their development.

### Stellar Classification

Stars are classified based on their spectral characteristics, which are determined by their temperature, luminosity, and composition. The most common classification system is the Morgan–Keenan (MK) system, which uses the letters O, B, A, F, G, K, and M to denote the spectral type of a star, with O stars being the hottest and M stars being the coolest.

**Variable Stars**: Stars that have periodic or random changes in luminosity due to changes in their internal structure or external environment. They are classified into 3 primary types:

- **Pulsating Variables**: Stars that vary in radius and luminosity over time, expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years, depending on the size of the star.
- **Eruptive Variables**: Stars that experience sudden increases in luminosity because of flares or mass ejection events.
- **Cataclysmic Variables**: Stars that undergo sudden and dramatic changes in luminosity due to violent events like novae or supernovae.

### Stellar Formation & Evolution

![Stellar Evolution](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Star_life_cycles_red_dwarf_en.svg/1920px-Star_life_cycles_red_dwarf_en.svg.png)

#### Molecular Cloud Collapse & Protostar Formation

The formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density — often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy).When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.

As the cloud collapses, individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas form "Bok globules". As a globule collapses and the density increases, the gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature rises until hydrogen fusion ignites. When the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, a **protostar** forms at the core. These pre-main-sequence stars are often surrounded by a protoplanetary disk and powered mainly by the conversion of gravitational energy.

These newly formed stars emit jets of gas along their axis of rotation, which may reduce the angular momentum of the collapsing star and result in small patches of nebulosity known as **Herbig–Haro objects**. These jets, in combination with radiation from nearby massive stars, may help to drive away the surrounding cloud from which the star was formed.

#### Main Sequence

Stars spend about 90% of their lifetimes fusing hydrogen into helium in high-temperature-and-pressure reactions in their cores. Starting at zero-age main sequence, the proportion of helium in a star's core will steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase, as will the star's temperature and luminosity.

The time a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has and the rate at which it fuses it. Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short-lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly. The mass–luminosity relation provides a fundamental link between a star’s mass and its energy output:

$$
L \propto M^\alpha
$$

where $\alpha \approx 3.5$ for stars with $m \leq 2 M_\odot$ and $\approx 4$ for stars with $m > 2 M_\odot$. This relation shows that even small increases in mass lead to significant increases in luminosity and, therefore, faster fuel consumption.

Every star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space. For most stars, the mass lost is negligible. However, for stars with a mass greater than 8 solar masses, the loss of mass can be significant. A star's metallicity can influence the time the star takes to burn its fuel, and controls the formation of its magnetic fields, which affects the strength of its stellar wind.

#### Post-Main Sequence

##### Red Dwarf and Red Giant

When a star exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core, it leaves the main sequence and enters the post-main-sequence phase. **Red dwarfs** become hotter and more luminous as they accumulate helium. When they eventually run out of hydrogen, they contract into a **white dwarf** and decline in temperature.

As stars of at least $0.4 M_\odot$ exhaust the supply of hydrogen at their core, they start to fuse hydrogen in a shell surrounding the helium core. The outer layers of the star expand and cool greatly as they transition into a red giant. As the hydrogen-burning shell produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a **red giant** of up to $2.25 M\odot$, the mass of the helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, core helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a **helium flash**, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch of the HR diagram.

After a star has fused the helium of its core, it begins fusing helium along a shell surrounding the hot carbon core. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the **asymptotic giant branch (AGB)** that parallels the other described red-giant phase, but with a higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo a brief period of carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate. During the AGB phase, stars undergo thermal pulses due to instabilities in the core of the star. In these thermal pulses, the luminosity of the star varies and matter is ejected from the star's atmosphere, ultimately forming a **planetary nebula**.

##### Massive Stars

For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch. During their helium-burning phase, a star of more than $9 M_\odot$ expands to form first a **blue supergiant** and then a **red supergiant**.

Massive stars exceeding $40 M_\odot$, do not become red supergiants due to high mass loss. These may instead evolve to a **Wolf–Rayet star**, characterised by spectra dominated by emission lines of elements heavier than hydrogen, which have reached the surface due to strong convection and intense mass loss, or from stripping of the outer layers.

When helium is exhausted at the core of a massive star, the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon. This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by neon, oxygen, and silicon. Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star. The final stage occurs when a massive star begins producing iron. Since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy.

#### Core Collapse & Stellar Remnants

As a star's core shrinks, the intensity of radiation from that surface increases, creating such radiation pressure on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a planetary nebula. If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than roughly $1.4 M_\odot$, it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth, known as a **white dwarf**. White dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place. The electron-degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs fade into **black dwarfs** over a very long period of time.

In massive stars, fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large ($gt 1.4 M_\odot$) that it can no longer support its own mass. This core will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons, forming neutrons, neutrinos, and gamma rays in a burst of electron capture and inverse beta decay. The shockwave formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a supernova. **Supernovae** become so bright that they may briefly outshine the star's entire home galaxy.

A supernova explosion blows away the star's outer layers, leaving a remnant. The core is compressed into a **neutron star**, which sometimes manifests itself as a pulsar or X-ray burster. In the case of stars having mass greater than $4 M_\odot$, the remnant is a **black hole**. In a neutron star the matter is in a state known as neutron-degenerate matter, with a more exotic form of degenerate matter, QCD matter, possibly present in the core.

### Stellar Structure

The structure of a star is determined by the balance between the force of gravity compressing the star and the pressure of the gas within the star pushing outward. The structure of a star can be divided into several layers:

- **Core**: The central region of a star where nuclear fusion occurs. The core is the hottest and densest part of the star and is where the energy generated by nuclear reactions is produced.
- **Radiative Zone**: The region of a star where energy is transported by radiation. In this zone, photons carry energy from the core to the outer layers of the star.
- **Convective Zone**: The region of a star where energy is transported by convection. In this zone, hot gas rises from the core to the surface, cools, and then sinks back down to be reheated.

## Threshold 3: Elements - The Stellar Origin of the Elements

The chemical elements that make up our Universe—from the hydrogen in water to the iron in our blood—were forged in the hearts of stars. Stellar nucleosynthesis is the process by which lighter nuclei combine to form heavier elements, and it takes place through a series of nuclear fusion reactions and neutron-capture processes.

### Stellar Nucleosynthesis

#### Hydrogen Burning

The primary nuclear reaction in stars is the fusion of hydrogen into helium, which occurs in the cores of stars with temperatures of around $10^7$ K. The type of hydrogen fusion process that dominates in a star is determined by the temperature dependency differences between the two reactions:

![Proton-Proton Chain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Fusion_in_the_Sun.svg/600px-Fusion_in_the_Sun.svg.png)

- The proton–proton chain reaction starts at temperatures about $4 \times 10^6$ K, making it the dominant fusion mechanism in smaller stars.

![CNO Cycle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/CNO_Cycle.svg/600px-CNO_Cycle.svg.png)

- A self-maintaining CNO chain requires a higher temperature of approximately $1.6 \times 10^7$ K, but thereafter it increases more rapidly in efficiency as the temperature rises, than does the proton–proton reaction. Above approximately $1.7 \times 10^7$ K, the CNO cycle becomes the dominant source of energy.

#### Helium Burning

When a star exhausts the hydrogen in its core, it begins to fuse helium into heavier elements. This process, known as helium burning, occurs in stars with temperatures of around $10^8$ K. In all cases, helium is fused to carbon via the triple-alpha process, i.e., three helium nuclei are transformed into carbon via Be-8.

![Triple-Alpha Process](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Triple-Alpha_Process.svg/620px-Triple-Alpha_Process.svg.png)

This can then form oxygen, neon, and heavier elements via the alpha process. In this way, the alpha process preferentially produces elements with even numbers of protons by the capture of helium nuclei. Elements with odd numbers of protons are formed by other fusion pathways.

![Alpha Process](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Kernfusionen1_en.png/960px-Kernfusionen1_en.png)

#### Fusion of heavier elements:

- **Carbon Burning**: Carbon burning occurs in the cores of massive stars (at least $4 M_\odot$). It requires high temperatures ($> 5 \times 10^8$ K or 50 keV) and densities ($> 3 \times 10^9 kg/m^3$). The primary reactions are:

$$
^{12}C + ^{12}C \rightarrow ^{20}Ne + ^4He
$$

$$
^{12}C + ^{12}C \rightarrow ^{23}Na + p
$$

- **Neon Burning**: Neon burning occurs in evolved massive stars (at least $8 M_\odot$) that combines neon into other elements. It requires high temperatures ($> 1.2 \times 10^9$ K or 100 keV) and densities ($> 10^10 kg/m^3$). The primary reactions are:

$$
^{20}Ne + \gamma \rightarrow ^{16}O + ^4He
$$

$$
^{20}Ne + ^4He \rightarrow ^{24}Mg + \gamma
$$

- **Oxygen Burning**: Oxygen burning occurs in the cores of massive stars that have used up the lighter elements in their cores. It requires high temperatures ($> 1.5-2.6 \times 10^9$ K) and densities ($2.6-6.7 \times 10^{12} kg/m^3$). The primary reactions are:

$$
^{16}O + ^{16}O \rightarrow ^{28}Si + ^4He
$$

$$
^{16}O + ^{16}O \rightarrow ^{31}P + ^1H
$$

$$
^{16}O + ^{16}O \rightarrow ^{31}S + n
$$

$$
^{16}O + ^{16}O \rightarrow ^{30}P + ^2D
$$

- **Silicon Burning**: Silicon burning occurs in the cores of massive stars with a minimum of $8-11 M_\odot$. This is the last stage of fusion in the core of a massive star before it collapses into a supernova. This follows the alpha process, where silicon is fused into heavier elements.

Fusion reactions beyond iron (Fe, A≈56) do not yield net energy; instead, they require energy input. This marks the cessation of energy production via fusion in stellar cores. When iron accumulates, the star faces instability leading to core collapse and eventual supernova.

#### Neutron Capture

Neutron capture is a process in which atomic nuclei capture free neutrons to form heavier nuclei. This process can occur in two ways:

- **rapid neutron capture (r-process)**: occurs in supernovae and neutron star mergers, where neutron densities are high and exposure times are short. It is responsible for the production of the heaviest elements in the periodic table. It usually synthesizes the most neutron-rich stable isotopes of each heavy element.

Immediately after the severe compression of electrons, beta-minus decay is blocked. This is because the high electron density fills all available free electron states up to a Fermi energy which is greater than the energy of nuclear beta decay. However, nuclear capture of those free electrons still occurs, and causes increasing neutronization of matter. This results in an extremely high density of free neutrons which cannot decay.

- **slow neutron capture (s-process)**: occurs in stars with low neutron densities and long exposure times, particularly asymptotic giant branch stars. It is responsible for the production of elements heavier than iron up to uranium.

In the s-process, a seed nucleus undergoes neutron capture to form an isotope with one higher atomic mass. If the new isotope is stable, a series of increases in mass can occur, but if it is unstable, then beta decay will occur, producing an element of the next higher atomic number. A range of elements and isotopes can be produced by the s-process, because of the intervention of alpha decay steps along the reaction chain. Each branch of the s-process reaction chain eventually terminates at a cycle involving lead, bismuth, and polonium.

## Threshold 4: Habitability - The Place of Life in the Universe

Our cosmic story is one of continuous evolution and structure formation. In this threshold, we bridge the gap between local origins and the vast cosmic network. We begin with the presolar nebula—the birthplace of our Solar System—and follow the intricate evolution of the Solar System, the Earth, and the Moon. Then, we zoom out to reveal how these objects are nested within increasingly larger cosmic structures, from the Local Interstellar Cloud to the Observable Universe and beyond.

### Presolar Nebula & Solar System Formation

The Solar System formed about 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a fragment of a giant molecular cloud, most likely at the edge of a Wolf-Rayet bubble. A shock wave from a supernova triggered the formation of the Sun by creating relatively dense regions within the cloud, causing these regions to collapse. The Sun formed within a cluster of between 1,000 and 10,000 stars with a diameter of between 6.5 and 19.5 light years and a collective mass of $3,000 M_\odot$. This cluster began to break apart between 135 million and 535 million years after formation.

Because of the conservation of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the temperature rose. The center, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200 AU and form a hot, dense protostar at the centre.

Within 50 million years, the temperature and pressure at the core of the Sun became so great that its hydrogen began to fuse, marking the Sun's entry into the prime phase of its life, known as the main sequence. As the early Solar System continued to evolve, it eventually drifted away from its siblings in the stellar nursery, and continued orbiting the Milky Way's center on its own. The Sun likely drifted from its original orbital distance from the center of the galaxy.

### Formation of the Planets

The planets of the Solar System formed from the protoplanetary disc, a rotating disk of gas and dust surrounding the young Sun. The planets formed through a process known as accretion, in which small particles in the protoplanetary disc collide and stick together they agglomerate by microphysical processes to form larger particles called planetesimals. During this stage, accumulation mechanisms are largely non-gravitational in nature.

The inner Solar System, the region of the Solar System inside 4 AU, was too warm for volatile molecules like water and methane to condense, so the planetesimals that formed there could only form from compounds with high melting points, such as metals and rocky silicates. These rocky bodies would become the terrestrial planets. These compounds are quite rare in the Universe, comprising only 0.6% of the mass of the nebula. The terrestrial embryos grew to about 0.05 Earth masses (ME) and ceased accumulating matter about 100,000 years after the formation of the Sun; subsequent collisions and mergers between these planet-sized bodies allowed terrestrial planets to grow to their present sizes.

When terrestrial planets were forming, they remained immersed in a disk of gas and dust. Pressure partially supported the gas and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as the planets. The resulting drag and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of angular momentum, and as a result the planets gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration, but the net trend was for the inner planets to migrate inward as the disk dissipated, leaving the planets in their current orbits.

The giant planets formed further out, beyond the frost line, which is the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to 4 ME within about 3 million years.

Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused the material to accumulate rapidly at ~5 AU from the Sun. This barrier prevented the formation of a planet at this location, which is why an asteroid belt formed instead.

The young Sun have far stronger stellar winds than more stable, older stars. Uranus and Neptune are thought to have formed after Jupiter and Saturn did, when the strong solar wind had blown away much of the disc material. As a result, those planets accumulated little hydrogen and helium—not more than 1 ME each. Uranus and Neptune may have formed closer to the Sun—near or even between Jupiter and Saturn—later migrating or being ejected outward.

After between three and ten million years, the young Sun's solar wind would have cleared away all the gas and dust in the protoplanetary disc, blowing it into interstellar space, thus ending the growth of the planets.

### Subsequent Evolution of the Solar System

At the end of the planetary formation epoch, the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon-to-Mars-sized protoplanets. Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100 million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape.

Orbital resonances with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in the asteroid belt, and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those resonances. Jupiter's gravity increased the velocity of objects within these resonances, causing them to shatter upon collision with other bodies, rather than accrete.

- **Late Heavy Bombardment**: The late heavy bombardment was a period of intense asteroid and comet impacts in the inner Solar System that occurred about 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago. This period is thought to have been caused by the migration of the giant planets, which disrupted the orbits of small bodies in the outer Solar System and sent them on a collision course with the inner planets.
- **Giant Impact Hypothesis**: The Moon is thought to have formed from the debris of a collision between the early Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia. This collision ejected material into orbit around the Earth, which eventually coalesced to form the Moon.

### The Cosmic Heirarchy

From the birth of the Earth to the vast structures of the cosmos, our place in the Universe is defined by a nested hierarchy of systems. Here, we explore the cosmic scale—from the smallest local structures to the full breadth of the Universe in a tabular format.

## Threshold 5: Life - The Emergence of Life on Earth

Life on Earth began about 3.5 billion years ago, and since then, it has evolved into a diverse array of organisms that inhabit every corner of the planet. The emergence of life on Earth is a complex process that involves the interaction of physical, chemical, and biological factors. In this threshold, we explore the origin of life on Earth and the factors that have shaped its evolution.

#### Proterozoic Eon

**The Great Oxidation event**: The deposition of banded iron formations peaked early in this period. These iron-rich formations were formed as anaerobic cyanobacteria produced waste oxygen that combined with iron, forming magnetite ($Fe_3O_4$, an iron oxide). This process removed iron from the Earth's oceans, presumably turning greenish seas clear. Eventually, with no remaining iron in the oceans to serve as an oxygen sink, the process allowed the buildup of an oxygen-rich atmosphere.
