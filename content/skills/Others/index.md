- I'm familiar with Linux and have used it for a long time. I've used Ubuntu and Kali Linux.
- I've also worked with penetration testing and cryptography for a while doing CTFs and solving challenges.
- Used Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, etc. for penetration testing. And LeetCode is my go-to platform for competitive programming.
