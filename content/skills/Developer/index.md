- I'm a full-stack developer and find myself comfortable with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I usually use Vue.js (Nuxt.js) or React.js (Next.js) for frontend development with Bootstrap or TailwindCSS for styling. I use Node.js (Express.js) for backend development.
- I've also worked with cross-platform mobile app development using Flutter and Dart. I've also worked with Android app development using Java and Kotlin in Android Studio.
